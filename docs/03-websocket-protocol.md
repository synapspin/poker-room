# WebSocket Protocol

All communication uses **Socket.IO** over WebSocket transport (`transports: ['websocket']`).

## Connection Lifecycle

```mermaid

    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server

    C->>S: WebSocket connect
    S->>C: connect event

    alt First visit (no saved userId)
        C->>S: player:register { name }
        S->>C: player:registered { id, userId, name, chips }
        Note over C: Save userId to localStorage
    else Returning visit (has userId)
        C->>S: player:reconnect { userId }
        alt Session found
            S->>C: player:reconnected { player, screen, activeTableId, gameState }
        else Session expired
            S->>C: player:reconnect:failed { reason: 'session_expired' }
            Note over C: Clear localStorage, show Login
        end
    end

    loop Every 5 seconds
        C->>S: heartbeat
        S->>C: heartbeat:ack { quality, serverTime }
    end
