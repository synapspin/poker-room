# Poker Room

Real-time multiplayer Texas Hold'em poker room with production-grade connection resilience.

**Stack**: NestJS + Socket.IO | React + Vite | TypeScript

## Features

- Texas Hold'em engine with full hand evaluation (Royal Flush → High Card)
- Real-time multiplayer via WebSocket (Socket.IO)
- Split-panel lobby with live table preview, filtering & sorting
- Spectator mode (watch games without playing)
- Waitlist system (auto-seat when spot opens)
- **Production-grade reconnection**: persistent identity, 60s grace period, auto-fold/sit-out
- **Custom heartbeat**: connection quality monitoring (stable/unstable/disconnected)
- **Action replay queue**: offline action buffering with server-side validation on reconnect
- Turn timers with auto-actions (30s normal, 15s disconnected)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install                    # Install all dependencies

# Terminal 1
cd backend && npm run start:dev   # Backend → http://localhost:3005

# Terminal 2
cd frontend && npm run dev        # Frontend → http://localhost:5173
```

Open 2+ browser tabs, register, create a table, and play.

## Connection Resilience

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    Connected --> SoftDisconnect : missed heartbeats (15s)
    SoftDisconnect --> Connected : heartbeat restored
    Connected --> GracePeriod : socket disconnect (60s timer)
    SoftDisconnect --> GracePeriod : socket disconnect
    GracePeriod --> Connected : reconnect within 60s
    GracePeriod --> SittingOut : expired → auto-fold
    SittingOut --> Connected : reconnect + sit back
    SittingOut --> Removed : 3 min timeout
```

- **Heartbeat**: client pings every 5s, server tracks quality
- **Grace period**: 60s to reconnect, seat reserved
- **Auto-actions**: disconnected player's turn → auto-fold/check after 15s
- **Action replay**: actions sent offline are buffered and replayed on reconnect
- **Sitting out**: auto sit-out after grace period, 3 min before removal

| **Game** | `game:join`, `game:leave`, `game:start`, `game:action` |
| **Replay** | `game:action:replay`, `game:action:ack` |
| **Spectator** | `game:spectate`, `game:preview`, `game:preview:state` |
| **Sit-out** | `game:sitout`, `game:sitback` |
| **Waitlist** | `game:waitlist:join`, `game:waitlist:leave`, `game:waitlist:promoted` |

## Design Decisions

- **In-memory storage** — all state resets on restart (PoC scope)
- **Persistent userId** — UUID in localStorage survives reconnects
- **Personalized state** — each player sees only their own cards (except showdown)
- **Spectator view** — all cards hidden, shared between spectators and lobby preview
- **Socket.IO rooms** — per-table rooms for efficient broadcasting
- **forwardRef modules** — resolves NestJS circular dependency between Lobby and Game modules
